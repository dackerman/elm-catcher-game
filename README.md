Catcher game in Elm
--------------------

Currently, this is more of an elm WebGL test as its just a few cubes moving around.  I started from [this great blog post](http://elm-lang.org/blog/announce/0.12.3.elm), and am building from there.

I'll be adding more interactive functionality as I learn more about Elm.

To run this demo, [install elm](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-platform/blob/master/README.md#elm-platform), then run these two commands:

    elm-get install
    elm-reactor

Then go to [http://localhost:8000/Game.elm](http://localhost:8000/Game.elm) to see falling spinning cubes.  Try to move your cylinder under the falling cubes to catch them and make your score go up.  The faster you can catch the cubes after they spawn, the more points you get.  If you miss a cube, you lose points.
